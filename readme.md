# ZLATMAX — Online Store

ZLATMAX is a multi-page online store front-end layout (Home, Catalog, Product pages) with a focus on typical e-commerce UI patterns: a multi-level navigation menu, product cards, interactive filters, and product galleries. The project showcases responsive layout techniques and JavaScript-driven components (sliders, custom selects, tooltips, spoilers/accordions).
